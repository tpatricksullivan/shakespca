    "Shakespeare's work is ideal for statistical analysis. He wrote many plays that vary widely from each other but he returns to the same themes in each one, sometimes even with the same characters. Still, his earliest audiences and readers recognized that some plays were similar to each other and others different. The First Folio, which was the first major printing to combine most of his works, grouped the plays in three categories: Comedies, Histories and Tragedies.\n",
